PokeTheme Battles is a web-based Pokemon Battle Simulator. The premise is battling with select themes that determine the set of Pokemon for each trainer to battle with. 

To play, select a theme via buttons on the side of the Pokeball, then press start. Then, choose a Pokemon to send out first based on your opponents team.

Currently, it can only be played against a computer trainer whose decisions are made randomly. I have intentions to run it on a server and enable battling against other users.
